            <p style="font-size: 17px;"> Parvati Hill is a hillock in Pune, India. The hillock rises to 2,100 feet above sea level. Atop the hillock is the Parvati Temple, one of the most scenic locations in Pune. The temple is the oldest heritage structure in Pune and was built during the rule of the Peshwa dynasty. For visitors, Parvati hill is also an observation point that offers a panoramic view of Pune. It is the second highest point in Pune. The hill has 108 steps leading to the top of the hill where the temple is situated. The hill was owned by the Patil named Taware. Peshwa purchased the hill to build a temple of Shiva. The Devi temple was believed to be of Taware's kulswami whose angara was able to cure a leg ailment of Kashibai, mother of Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao. Thereafter, the Peshwa built a temple complex there. The main temple, Devdeveshwara, is made of blackstone. It was completed under Balaji Baji Rao in 1749, and a gold pinnacle was added to the temple in 1760. Other temples are dedicated to Vitthal and Rukmini, Vishnu, and Kartikeya.</p>
